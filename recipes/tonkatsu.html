    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For those of you who are new to this Japanese dish, tonkatsu consists of tender pork loin (or fillet) that has been breaded and deep-fried to crunchy perfection.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <strong>For the Sesame Dipping Sauce:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp toasted black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce</li>
        <strong>For the Breading:</strong>
        <li>1/2 cup panko</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <strong>For the Tonkatsu:</strong>
        <li>2 boneless pork loin chops (1/2 inch thick)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>3 cups neutral oil</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Grind 1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds and 1 Tbsp toasted black sesame seeds with a Japanese pestle and mortar. Leave some seeds unground for texture.</li>
        <li>Divide the ground sesame seeds among individual dipping plates or bowls. Then divide 4 Tbsp tonkatsu sauce (store bought or homemade) among the dipping plates. Set aside until ready to serve. Each person can mix it together when they are ready to eat.</li>
        <li>If you are using dry panko from the store, add ½ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) to a deep dish and spray with water until the panko is moist (I use this mister). Set aside for 15 minutes, or until the panko becomes soft and tender. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the other breading ingredients. Crack 1 large egg (50 g each w/o shell) in a deep dish and add ½ Tbsp neutral oil. Whisk together until well combined. By adding oil, the meat and breading won’t detach from each other while deep-frying and the juice and flavor from the meat will not escape easily. Then, prepare another deep dish with 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour).</li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to remove and discard the extra fat from 2 boneless pork loin chops (½ inch thick). Then, make several slits on the connective tissue (white area) between the meat and fat. </li>
        <li>After one hour, take out the batter from the refrigerator. Add 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), ½ cup tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps), and ¼ cup pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga) to the bowl. Mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Flip the meat and make several slits on the other side of the connective tissue</li>
        <li>Pound both sides of the meat with the back of a knife or a meat tenderizer/mallet.</li>
        <li>Mold the meat back into its original shape with your hands.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the meat with ½ tsp kosher salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Dredge the pork in the flour and dust off any excess. Excess flour will create a coating that prevents the egg mixture from adhering to the pork. Next, dip the pork into the egg mixture and coat well.</li>
        <li>Finally, dredge the pork in the fresh panko, gently pressing the panko onto the pork. Gently shake off any excess panko, then place the pork pieces onto a tray or plate. While deep-frying, the panko will “puff up,” so at this stage they don’t have to be fluffy. Set it aside for 5–10 minutes so the breading will set.</li>
        <li>Add 3 cups neutral oil to the pot and bring it to 340ºF (170ºC) over medium heat. Make sure your oil is 1¾–2 inches (5 cm) deep in the pot. </li>
        <li>Gently put one piece of pork into the oil and cook for 1 minute (without flipping). Don‘t touch the pork for 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>After a minute, flip the pork and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Take out the pork and remove excess oiul by holding it vertically over the pot for a few seconds while the oil drips off. Place it on a wire rack or paper towel and let it sit for 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>urn off the heat temporarily and scoop up and discard any fried crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh strainer. It’s very important to keep the oil clean and crumb free so the oil does not get darker and dirtier with burnt crumbs. Turn on the heat and bring the oil back to 340ºF (170ºC).</li>
        <li>While the first cutlet is resting on the wire rack, deep-fry the second piece of pork for 1 minute without flipping. Remember not to touch it for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Take out the pork and remove the excess oil as before. Place it on the wire rack and let the residual heat cook the pork for 4 minutes. Scoop up and discard the fried crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh strainer.</li>
        <li>The first piece of pork should now be ready for its second frying. Bring the oil to 355ºF (180ºC) and fry the pork for 30 seconds on each side. Remove from the pot and drain the excess oil by holding the cutlet vertically over the wire rack or paper towels for 2 minutes. This prevents the breading from getting soggy on one side.</li>
        <li>Scoop up and discard the fried crumbs in the oil, then continue the second frying of the second cutlet. Remove from the pot and drain the excess oil as before.</li>
    </ol>
