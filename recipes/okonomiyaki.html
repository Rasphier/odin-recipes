    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A popular street food from Osaka, Okonomiyaki is a delicious Japanese savory pancake “grilled as you like it“ with your choice of protein and tasty condiments and toppings. My recipe includes the 6 key ingredients that give your Okonomiyaki a truly authentic taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <strong>For the batter:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>5.6 oz nagaimo</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dashi</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tenkasu</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pickled red ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>For the sauce:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>3 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp sugar, and 1/4 tsp baking powder.</li>
        <li>Peel and grate 5.6 oz nagaimo in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the grated nagaimo and 3/4 cup dashi to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix it all together until combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 1/2 Tbsp sugar, 2 Tbsp oyster sauce, 1/4 cup ketchup, and 3 1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Mix together until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>After one hour, take out the batter from the refrigerator. Add 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell), ½ cup tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps), and ¼ cup pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga) to the bowl. Mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the minced cabbage to the batter, one-third of it at a time. Mix well before adding the rest.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat a bit of neutral oil on medium heat. When the frying pan is hot (400ºF or 200ºC), spread the batter in a circle on the pan. </li>
        <li>Place 2–3 slices of pork belly on top of the okonomiyaki and cook covered for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the bottom side is nicely browned, flip it over.</li>
        <li>Gently press the okonomiyaki to fix its shape and keep it together. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip it over one last time and cook uncovered for 2 minutes. If you’re going to cook the next batch, transfer the cooked okonomiyaki to a plate. Spread sauce on top with a brush or spoon.</li>
    </ol>
